# Structural modeling of EIF2γ and EIF2Bγ (both truncated and full-length isoforms)
 
#### by Büşra Savaş and Ezgi Karaca

## Motivation

bla bla


## Our folders describe:

- **Models:** contains the PDB files of I-patch domain of both isoforms modelled with I-TASSER, iDrug, TrRosetta, Ab-initio Rosetta and QUARK servers. 
- **Initial_structures:** contains all the relevant input files for HADDOCK runs.
- **HADDOCK_runs:** contains the HADDOCK output files of truncated and full-length isoforms
- **PQR_files:** contains the PQR files of refined structures obtained by PDB2PQR server.
