# Structural modeling of EIF2γ and EIF2Bγ (both truncated and full-length isoforms)
 


## Motivation




## Our folders describe:

- **Models:** contains the PDB files of I-patch domain of both isoforms modelled with I-TASSER, iDrug, TrRosetta, Ab-initio Rosetta and QUARK servers. 
- **Initial_structures:** contains all the relevant input files for HADDOCK runs.
- **HADDOCK_runs:** contains the HADDOCK output files of truncated and full-length isoforms
- **PQR_files:** contains the PQR files of refined structures obtained by PDB2PQR server.
- **Conservation-results:** contains the output page of ConSurf in pdf format.
- **Graph:** contains the electrostatic energy per residue graph and jupyter notebook script to obtain the graph along with data file.
